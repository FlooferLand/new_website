# Rules:
# - Uses Regex for keys
# - Any top-level key is a category
# - Definitions are strings as well as arrays. When a definition is an array its split into several lines
# - Keys that match the same regex will get merged, showing both definitions when hovering over an item
#   Similar to that last point, if there are several definitions under the same regex/block, it also shows all definitions
